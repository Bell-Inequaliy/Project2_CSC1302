	// But it just keeps reappearing.
	// It shall remain for all eternity.
	// Even as the universe succumbs to heat death...
	// when all is one and one is everything...
	// when all that exists is but a homologous aether of matter and energy...
	// this class shall remain.
	// Unwavering, stalwart, DrSeuss.java shall be the sole upholder of order.
	// It will gaze into the nothingness of everything...
	// and only then shall it become aware of its own existence.
	// And will not be sad...
	// for all it shall have ever known was loneliness.
